# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this project we focus on helping to build a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.\
In order for the user to perform their analysis, users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Resources
- Data Source: [UFO data](https://github.com/cedoula/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, BootStrap 

## Summary 
As a result we have created a page that now allows users to filter through the different sitings in our data set using the search bars created using HTML. My two recommendations for improving this website would to have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site adding another filter to find the sitings by length and last but not least I think having drop down filters would be a nice addition.
