# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this project we focus on helping to build a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings.\
In order for the user to perform their analysis, users will be able to filter the UFO sightings table based on multiple criteria such as the event date, city, state, country, and shape.
